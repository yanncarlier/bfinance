"""keccakf1600.py

Keccak is a family of hash functions based on the sponge construction. It was
chosen by NIST to become the SHA-3 standard. This code implements the
Keccak-f[1600] permutation. Detailed information about this function can be
found on the official site [1]. Original implementation [2] by the Keccak Team.

Some caveats about the implementation:
    * width `b` of permutation is fixed as 1600 (5 * 5 * 64), which means
    the number of rounds is 24 (12 + 2ℓ, ℓ = log_2(b / 25))
    * ρ step could have its offsets pre-computed as the array `r`.
    * ι step could have its round constants pre-computed as the array `RC`.

def keccak_f_1600(state):
    """The inner permutation for the Keccak sponge function.

    The Keccak-f permutation is an iterated construction consisting of a
    sequence of almost identical rounds. It operates on a state array with
    each of the twenty-four rounds performing five steps, described below
    with detail.

    The loops above and below the core of the permutation are used to save and
    restore the state array to a stream of bytes, used outside the permutation.
    The original state array has three dimensions, whereas this characteristic
    can be cleverly optimized to a 5x5 matrix with 64-bit words. As such, this
    implementation makes use of this trick and stores an entire lane (a z-axis
    set of bits within the state) as a single word.

    The θ step diffuses the bits alongside the state array by calculating the
    parity of nearby columns relative to a lane.

    The ρ and π steps are merged; together, they move more bits around
    according to two alike recurrence relations.

    The χ step is similar to an S-box permutation; it makes the whole round
    non-linear with a few logic operations on bits inside a line.

    The ι step is a simple LFSR that breaks the symmetry of the rounds. It
    generates constants by doing computations according to the round number
    and its previous output, modulo polynomials over GF(2)[x].

    Args:
        state:  square matrix of order 5 that holds the input bytes.

    Returns:
        state:  bytes permuted by Keccak-f[1600].
