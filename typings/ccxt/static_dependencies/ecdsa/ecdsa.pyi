Implementation of Elliptic-Curve Digital Signatures.

Classes and methods for elliptic-curve signatures:
private keys, public keys, signatures,
NIST prime-modulus curves with modulus lengths of
192, 224, 256, 384, and 521 bits.

Example:

  # (In real-life applications, you would probably want to
  # protect against defects in SystemRandom.)
  from random import SystemRandom
  randrange = SystemRandom().randrange

  # Generate a public/private key pair using the NIST Curve P-192:

  g = generator_192
  n = g.order()
  secret = randrange( 1, n )
  pubkey = Public_key( g, g * secret )
  privkey = Private_key( pubkey, secret )

  # Signing a hash value:

  hash = randrange( 1, n )
  signature = privkey.sign( hash, randrange( 1, n ) )

  # Verifying a signature for a hash value:

  if pubkey.verifies( hash, signature ):
    print_("Demo verification succeeded.")
  else:
    print_("*** Demo verification failed.")

  # Verification fails if the hash value is modified:

  if pubkey.verifies( hash-1, signature ):
    print_("**** Demo verification failed to reject tampered hash.")
  else:
    print_("Demo verification correctly rejected tampered hash.")

Version of 2009.05.16.

Revision history:
      2005.12.31 - Initial version.
      2008.11.25 - Substantial revisions introducing new classes.
      2009.05.16 - Warn against using random.randrange in real applications.
      2009.05.17 - Use random.SystemRandom by default.
